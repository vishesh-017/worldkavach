// Force-reload tabs running a stale frontend bundle when a newer deploy is
// live. Catches the class of bug where users keep a tab open across a
// wire-shape change (e.g. PR #3466 fixing the setPreferences CONFLICT
// propagation) and end up in a permanent retry loop against the new server
// because their JS doesn't understand the new response shape.
//
// Mechanism: on tab focus, fetch /build-hash.txt (a static asset emitted by
// the Vite plugin in vite.config.ts at build time, content = the deployed
// SHA) and compare against __BUILD_HASH__ baked into the running bundle.
// Mismatch → hard reload.
//
// /build-hash.txt is intentionally NOT under /api/* so installWebApiRedirect
// does NOT rewrite it to the canonical API host — it stays same-origin with
// the bundle, which is the correct comparison target.
//
// The reload never fires under an open modal (#8577). Returning to the app is
// this module's main trigger, and it is also how a user gets back from their
// mail app with a Clerk email verification code, so an unguarded reload wiped
// the sign-up they were halfway through. A mismatch found under a modal is
// remembered in `pendingReload` and the module stops fetching; every later
// trigger retries the reload against the live DOM until one lands. What counts
// as blocking is `findReloadBlockingModal`, shared with the service-worker
// updater — every first-party overlay declares its reload contract with
// `declareOverlay`, and 'safe' surfaces (a read-only display, a prompt that
// re-appears on the next load) do not hold the reload off. Silence blocks, and
// a silent surface that auto-opens with no auto-dismiss wedges the tab for the
// session (WORLDMONITOR-15X/15Z: first the onboarding popover, then the
// SignalModal, neither of which is the sign-up case this guard is for).
